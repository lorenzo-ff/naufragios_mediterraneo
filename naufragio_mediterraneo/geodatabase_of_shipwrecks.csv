The site is badly damaged by wave action and strong currents, but the extent of the scatter and the presence of several interesting amphora types make it worthy of more intensive mapping and study. Dating probably around the very early 2nd century AD, the ship appears to have been carrying a mixed cargo in three or four amphora types. It is the only wreck of its date so far reported off the coast of Cyprus. The cargo’s generally regional character, interspersed with a few long-distance imports that were likely picked up locally at some port in the northeast Mediterranean, fits well with the wreck’s location not far offshore and may indicate an involvement in short-haul coasting commerce. About half the wreck is stil to be investigated.",,,,Storage and cooking items were also found,,,,

The main cargo of this medium-sized ship must have been perishable as there are no signs of it. An interesting feature is the carpenter's set of new nails (cf a Hellenistic wreck from Apollonia and a Byzantine wreck south of Haifa).",,,"Five broken, twisted and torn fragments of lead sheathing. Planks with a thickness of 4-5cm and the scattered nails indicate that the ship measured 15-25m.","Sixteen lead artefacts definable as fishing gear sinkers, three of which are decorated with patterns and unidentifiable inscriptions. Eight bronze weights with an inner lead core weighing between 0.9kg to 26 kg were also recovered along with three bronze balance scales. A set of bronze vessels were found in a relatively small area 3 x3m comprising an oil lamp, 2 ladles and an (incense?) shovel possibly used as a ceremonial group - other Israeli finds indicate ritual activities were carried out on board Greco-Roman ships. A metre long bronze trumpet was also found, an unusual find on a wreck site but it may well have had a nautical use like the modern fog horn.","Four iron anchors (1.5-2m long) were found, a pair of 2-armed anchors with their stocks not inserted and two 1-armed anchors with their stocks in place. The 2-armed anchors can be classified as Kapitan intermediate type between A and B, thus dating them to the C2nd-1st BC, whilst 1-armed anchors from antiquity are relatively rare (another was found on the Ma'agan Michael wreck). Both used and unused copper alloy nails with round cross-section were also found - 53 new, straight nails in an area 2m x 2m, probably belonging to the ship's carpenter, whilst the old ones were spread over the site. Generally in Israel, nails of this type come from Hellenistic/Roman ships, cf Megadim wreck. A lead sounding weight was found nearby but its late from means it  may be an intrusion and not from this wreck.",,,

This incremental graduation suggests that the eight drums and one capital comprise a single column over 30 feet tall. Newly quarried stone as the drums are not fluted and still preserve traces of corkscrew-shaped hoisting grooves. A group of large rectangular marble blocks which probably represent architectural elements associated with the column. This area also yielded an interesting array of newly-quarried, roughly-finished marble objects such as a small hand basin, the pedestal for one of two larger basins, and at least 6 uninscribed grave stones or stele. More than a dozen marble blocks.","Undecorated, utilitarian cookware (plates, casseroles). Numerous Italian ceramics including cooking pans. Several types of typical Hellenistic fineware (moldmade bowls, grey ware, and black glaze cups, bowls, and salt cellars).Nine bronze handles.","More than 250 fasteners, most of them copper (or copper alloy?) nails and enough small but well-preserved wood fragments to suggest that some hull remains have survived beneath one or more of the drums. At least 24 timbers have been sent for analysis and some of the transverse timbers were made of ash.","The head of a double axe, an axe-adze, a tool for removing nails, a chisel, (all in concretion). The remains of a large metal cauldron, an intact ceramic jug and a terracotta herm figurine. A worn and corroded bronze coin, probably Greek.","An anchor (in concretion, which with two lead anchor collars shows the transition from the use of wooden anchors to the introduction of iron anchors), a lead sounding weight, and an elaborate iron concretion that probably represents an important part of the ship's equipment.",,,

Six seasons of exploration, ending in 2009, revealed a narrow trail of pottery about 100 feet long at the northern end of the wreck, according to the US journal Archaeology. This broadened out over an area 65 by 50 feet, and Dr Hadjidaki estimates that the ship itself was between 32 and 50 feet long. It had capsized as it sank, spreading the cargo across the sea-bed. She believes the ship probably looked something like the one shown on a sealstone found on Pseira in 1991, with a beaked prow, high stern, and single mast anchored by ropes. It was probably a coasting vessel, delivering everyday goods to ports along the Cretan shore; whether it used a sails, oars or both is not known. More than 200 pottery vessels have been recovered, about 80 of which are complete enough to be identifiable as amphorae and large jars, used for shipping liquids such as wine and olive oil. Philip Betancourt has dated all the vessels to roughly 1800-1675BC, and the clay from which they were made suggests that the ship took on cargo at two or more locations in eastern Crete.",,"Ceramics including jugs, cups and cooking pots.",,,,,,

The keel is preserved for a length of 5.2m. There is evidence of charring on some planks above and beneath the frame stations near the post, indicating that the burn marks are not the result of a haphazard blaze, but rather that the planks were charred prior to their attachment to the frames.  The charring was localized to the extremities of the strakes.  These considerations led  J.R. Steffy to conclude that the burn marks are the result of ""char-bending,"" a process in which water-soaked planks are bent to shape as they are heated over a fire.
